# F-Developer-Test
developer test for summer internship role 2022

The project is developed using c#, .net framework(windows forms) and MS Acess. C# and Windows forms are used to create front-end of the application.
I have used Microsoft Accees to store and fetch data, the file name is job.accdb in FdevTest folder
Please download the project and open file name "FdevTest" in the following directory: FdevTest\FdevTest.
Run the file in visual studio. The first form will load and displays a button (View Job list) on click, it will open a new window to joblist.
user can click on job no. and it will display job details accordinlgy.

Regrads,
Vijay
